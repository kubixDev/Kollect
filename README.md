## About

**Kollect** is a collectible-oriented social network app designed in Java for Android that allows users to organize their K-Pop photocard collection, share their wishlists with others and discover new artists!

This app is currently being developed as a personal project, which I started with the aim of obtaining new skills and organizing my Twice photocards.

<br>

## Features

Some of the main Kollect features
* ability to create an account and customize your profile
* an explore page where you can search for photocards by groups and their individual members
* ability to save your owned photocards and add missing ones to your wishlist
* cloud storage, which allows you to show off your collection on any device
* user search and profile viewing
* modern and responsive UI design

<br>

## Technologies

The project uses
* **Java 17** - the application's core logic, general functionality
* **Firestore** - used to create and manage the NoSQL database for scalable data storage for users, artists, group members and photocard details
* **Cloud Storage** - used for seamless access to photocard images, artists cover photos and users profile pictures
* **Firebase Auth** - used to handle account creation, management and authentication
* **Glide** - an image loading framework
* **SDP library** - provides easier support for different screen sizes
* **Gradle** - a default build automation tool

<br>
